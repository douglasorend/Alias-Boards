[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This Mod allows you to Alias/Symlink or more commonly known for windows users as shortcuts.
This emulates another board by copying its data into another location. This will show on the MessageIndex as well.

Please note, If you alias a board to another category, there must be at least ONE board in that category visible or nothing will be shown.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was recently tested on SMF 2.0.9, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF v1.1 thru v1.1.9, as well as SMF 1.0.x is not and will not be supported.

If you are uninstalling, please note that it will not remove the database additions, you will have to run [b]database_remove.php[/b] manually to remove the fields this mod adds.
